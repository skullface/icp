OVERVIEW

We offer our products and services to as broad an audience as possible,
complying with the laws where we operate. Our business decisions are guided
by our leadership principles.

COMMUNITY AND CUSTOMER STANDARDS
We maintain and enforce a published Acceptable Use Policy that governs
participation and interaction on our platform. Customers, as well as other
users, are expected to abide by this policy.

DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS
We will not uphold relationships with customers whose behaviors actively
cause harm to others. We determine “harm” as behaviors inconsistent with the
United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights
<https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights>. 
If a customer has knowingly violated these human rights, we will terminate
the relationship.

We aim to work with organizations that model the principles of the 
United Nations Global Compact
<https://www.unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/mission/principles>,
provided here and edited for clarity:

  - Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally
    proclaimed human rights and make sure that they are not complicit in
    human rights abuses.
  - Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective
    recognition of the right to collective bargaining, the elimination of all
    forms of forced and compulsory labour, the effective abolition of child
    labour, and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment
    and occupation. 
  - Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental
    challenges, undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental
    responsibility, and encourage the development and diffusion of
    environmentally friendly technologies. 
  - Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including
    extortion and bribery.
